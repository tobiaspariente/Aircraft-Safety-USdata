# Flatiron School Phase #1 Project - Aviation Safety Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization to generate insights for a business stakeholder interested in expanding into the aviation industry. Specifically, the goal is to determine which aircraft pose the least risk for a company looking to invest in commercial and private aviation.

## Business Problem

The company is exploring opportunities to purchase and operate aircraft for commercial and private enterprises. To make an informed decision, they need to understand the potential risks associated with different aircraft types. The objective is to provide actionable insights that will guide the head of the new aviation division in choosing which aircraft to purchase.

## The Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023. This includes civil aviation accidents and selected incidents both in the United States and international waters. The data is available in the file `AviationData.csv`.

## Key Points

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and ensured data integrity.
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to present findings effectively.

## Files in Repository

- **`AviationData.csv`**: The raw dataset containing aviation accident data.
- **`EDA.ipynb`**: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook, detailing the initial exploration of the data, including data visualization and preliminary insights.
- **`dataclean.ipynb`**: Data Cleaning notebook, showcasing the steps taken to clean and preprocess the data.
- **`finalanalysis.ipynb`**: Final Analysis notebook, presenting the comprehensive analysis and actionable insights, including the top recommendations for aircraft safety.
- **`presentation.pdf`**: Final slides for non-technical stakeholders presentation of my findings.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, three concrete business recommendations are provided to help the company make informed decisions regarding aircraft purchases. These recommendations are derived from a thorough examination of the data and are supported by visualizations to make the findings accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## Visualizations

Several visualizations are included to illustrate key findings. These visuals are designed to highlight the most critical points and support the recommendations. The visualizations include bar charts and line graphs, formatted for clarity and impact.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or further explore the data, clone this repository and open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed to run the notebooks.
